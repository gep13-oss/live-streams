# Gary Ewan Park - Twitch

I have recently started streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gep13), on topics such as Chocolatey, Cake, and general Windows Automation topcis.  I intend this to be a weekly stream, on a Monday evening at 8pm (GMT), but this may be subject to change.  If you have any ideas for topics that you would like to see covered on one of these streams, then please feel to raise an issue in this repository, and I will do my best to cover them in a future streams.
